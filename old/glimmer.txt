<section name="glimmer" title="What is Glimmer?">

You may be wondering why this is called the <em>Glimmer</em> guide.
Glimmer is the Grinnell Laboratory for Interactive Multimedia Research
and Experimentation.  Since a primary target of this work is my research
students, it made sense to name it for my lab.  (That also means that my
research students will be encouraged to work on it.)
