<section name="books" title="Recommended Books and Other Readings">

As I note in <a href="why.html">the introduction</a>, there are a host
of useful books and articles on C and Unix/Linux.  Here are some of my
favorites.

<section name="starnix" title="Unix/Linux">

<a name="raymond-taoup">
Eric S. Raymond. 2003. The Art of UNIX Programming. Pearson Education.
Available online at
<!--{<http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/>}-->.
</a>

<blockquote>
A really nice overview.  And available for free.  What else could you
want?

<section name="c" title="C">

<a name="kandr">
Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie. 1988. <em>The C Programming
Language</em> (2nd ed.). Prentice Hall Professional Technical Reference.
</a>

<blockquote>
The ANSI-C edition of the book that introduced C.  To me, K&amp;R is close
to a perfect text - it's concise, it's written by programmers for programmers,
it's self-reflexive (in that you need to understand a bit of C to understand
the examples that pepper the introductory chapters), and it's clear.  I
teach our introductory C course with this book and, even though it's not
designed for introductory students, and puzzles some, I think it's the
right book.
