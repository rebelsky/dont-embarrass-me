<em>NOTES!</em>

I've said that one of the most important things you can do is to learn
a core set of *nix tools.  Some you need to know how to use (at least the
basics).  Others you only need to know that they exist, since you can
read the man page.

* <code>man</code> and <code>info</code>
* A powerful text editor, preferably <code>vi</code> (also <code>vim</code>,
  the mangled version of vi) or Emacs.
* <code>sed</code>, the steam editor.
* <code>tr</code>.
* <code>od</code>.
* <code>make</code>.

You also need to know <a href="bash-basics.html">some basic scripting
techniques in bash</a>, including pipes and I/O redirection.
