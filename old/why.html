<h1><a name="why">Introduction: Why This Book?</a></h1>

<p>
Does the world really need another book on C and/or Unix/Linux?
No, probably not.  (It probably also doesn't need sentences
with two slashes in a row.)  There are a host of excellent <a
href="books.html">books</a> on both topics, from Kernighan and Ritchie's
classic <em>The C Programming Language</em> to Eric Raymond's <em><a
href="http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/">The Art of Unix
Programming</a></em>.
</p>

<p>
So, why am I writing yet another book on the subjects?  Well, I've
observed that the students I higher for summer research or have in
upper-level classes don't demonstrate the mastery of certain topics that
I'd like, even though they've been using C since the second course and
Linux since the first course.  They aren't facile with make and gdb.
They don't rely on macros.  They are unaware of key compiling flags.
I was tempted to title this book <q>Don't Embarass Me</q> (or <q>Don't
Embarass Yourself</q>), but that seemed a bit harsh.  Nonethless, I don't
think our students should leave Grinnell without better mastery of these
topics.  And I certainly want my research students to know these things
before they start working for me.
</p>

<p>
So, what options are available to me to make sure that my students better
reach the understanding they need?  I could send them to the books.
I could create a short collection of excerpts (particularly of the
materials that are released under Creative Commons or some similar
license).  I could teach a one-credit course (and I am).  But I think
my students, particularly my research students, would benefit from short
summaries of my perspective on these topics.
</p>

<p>
Well, that's enough of an introduction.  Let's get started.  I'd recommend
that you begin with the introduction to the general Unix/Linux section or
the introduction to the C section.
